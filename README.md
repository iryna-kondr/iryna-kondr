Falcon is a Python library designed for effortless training of production-ready machine learning models. Our primary objective is to simplify both the training process and the deployment of models to any target platform. To achieve this, we have incorporated native support for exporting the entire pipelines into the ONNX format, enabling seamless deployment of models across various environments. With Falcon, training and deploying your models becomes as easy as a single line of code.
